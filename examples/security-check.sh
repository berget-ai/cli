Analyze this git diff for security risks and vulnerabilities:

1. **Sensitive information**: API keys, passwords, tokens, secrets
2. **Injection risks**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
3. **Authentication/authorization**: Weak controls, privilege escalation
4. **Cryptography**: Weak encryption, hardcoded keys
5. **Input validation**: Insufficient validation, buffer overflows
6. **File handling**: Path traversal, unsafe file operations
7. **Network security**: Insecure connections, CSRF
8. **Logging**: Sensitive data in logs, information disclosure

Provide a security assessment:
- üü¢ SAFE: No security risks identified
- üü° WARNING: Minor security risks that should be addressed
- üî¥ CRITICAL: Serious security risks that MUST be addressed

Format:
**SECURITY ASSESSMENT: [üü¢/üü°/üî¥] [SAFE/WARNING/CRITICAL]**

**IDENTIFIED RISKS:**
- [List specific risks if any]

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- [Concrete actions to address the risks]
