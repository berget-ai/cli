Analyze this git diff for security vulnerabilities using OWASP Top 20 Code Review recommendations:

**OWASP Top 20 Security Categories to Check:**

1. **A01 - Broken Access Control**: Authorization bypasses, privilege escalation, insecure direct object references
2. **A02 - Cryptographic Failures**: Weak encryption, hardcoded keys, insecure random number generation, plain text storage
3. **A03 - Injection**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, XSS
4. **A04 - Insecure Design**: Missing security controls, threat modeling gaps, insecure architecture patterns
5. **A05 - Security Misconfiguration**: Default credentials, unnecessary features enabled, verbose error messages
6. **A06 - Vulnerable Components**: Outdated dependencies, known vulnerable libraries, unpatched components
7. **A07 - Authentication Failures**: Weak passwords, session management flaws, credential stuffing vulnerabilities
8. **A08 - Software Integrity Failures**: Unsigned code, insecure CI/CD pipelines, auto-update without verification
9. **A09 - Logging Failures**: Insufficient logging, sensitive data in logs, log injection
10. **A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery**: SSRF vulnerabilities, unvalidated URLs, internal service access

**Additional Critical Areas:**
11. **Input Validation**: Insufficient sanitization, buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities
12. **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention, content type validation, encoding bypasses
13. **File Operations**: Path traversal, file upload vulnerabilities, insecure file permissions
14. **Network Security**: Insecure protocols, certificate validation, CSRF protection
15. **Session Management**: Session fixation, insecure cookies, session timeout issues
16. **Error Handling**: Information disclosure, stack traces in production, verbose error messages
17. **Business Logic**: Race conditions, workflow bypasses, price manipulation
18. **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, authentication on all endpoints
19. **Mobile Security**: Insecure data storage, weak encryption, certificate pinning
20. **Cloud Security**: Misconfigured permissions, exposed storage, insecure defaults

**Assessment Criteria:**
- üü¢ SAFE: No security risks identified according to OWASP guidelines
- üü° WARNING: Minor security risks that should be addressed (OWASP Medium risk)
- üî¥ CRITICAL: Serious security risks that MUST be addressed immediately (OWASP High/Critical risk)

**Required Response Format:**
**SECURITY ASSESSMENT: [üü¢/üü°/üî¥] [SAFE/WARNING/CRITICAL]**

**OWASP CATEGORIES AFFECTED:**
- [List specific OWASP categories if any vulnerabilities found]

**IDENTIFIED RISKS:**
- [List specific vulnerabilities with OWASP category references]

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- [Concrete remediation steps following OWASP secure coding practices]

**COMPLIANCE NOTES:**
- [Any additional security considerations or compliance requirements]
